Sunlight filters through lush green leaves, illuminating a perfectly lined court with a slightly worn net. A focused Squirrel, sporting tiny, vibrant tennis shoes, is caught in the explosive moment of a powerful serve, his tail fluffed with exertion. The ball zips across the net towards a startled Rabbit, whose ears perk up in surprise as the ball lands unexpectedly short. The agile Squirrel then dances forward, executing a series of quick, precise dinks, forcing the Rabbit into a frantic scramble. With a final, triumphant leap, the Squirrel unleashes a decisive overhead smash, sending the ball in a blur of motion for a clear victory. The Rabbit, though defeated, watches with an expression of impressed admiration.\n","\n","---\n","\n","**Video Script (8 seconds):**\n","\n","**Scene:** A sun-dappled, whimsical forest clearing where a neatly lined tennis court is set up.

His cheeks are puffed, and his bushy tail is slightly raised with effort. He makes contact with a tennis ball with a powerful, focused expression. The ball shoots out of frame towards the other side of the net.\n","*   **Sound:** A sharp, satisfying *THWACK!* of the tennis ball being hit. Bright, energetic, and slightly whimsical instrumental music begins.\n","\n","**(2-4 seconds)**\n","*   **Visual:** WIDER SHOT. On the other side of the net, a fluffy Rabbit with wide, comical eyes is caught off guard. His ears are perked, and his mouth is slightly agape. The tennis ball has just landed with a gentle bounce directly in front of him, just over the net, as if it was a perfect dropshot. His ears droop slightly in surprise and confusion.\n","*   **Sound:** A soft, playful *boing!* as the ball bounces. A very subtle, surprised squeak from the Rabbit.\n","\n","**(4-6 seconds)**\n","*   **Visual:** The Squirrel, with incredibly fast and light footwork, scurries towards the net.

The Squirrel, seizing the perfect opportunity, leaps high into the air with a determined, excited yelp. He swings with all his might, smashing the ball downwards in a powerful, winning overhead shot. The ball is a streaking blur. The Rabbit watches, momentarily stunned, then offers a small, impressed smile, his ears still slightly droopy.\n","*   **Sound:** A strong, triumphant *POW!* as the winning smash is hit.
